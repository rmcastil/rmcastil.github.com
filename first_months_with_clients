- talk like you already have the client
- 'Really look forward to working with you'
- use emails for just being nice, not necessarily for discussing concrete business details. That's what MSAs and SOW are for
- always let the client have the last word


Feedback from Clients
===

- Want to hire people better than their current team members to scale
- new members need to move faster and join team seemlessly
- be clear on availability and manage expections. Communicate. "What do you want this to look like when done"
- Communicate. Exploratory questions up front. Clients hire contractors because they don't want to manage employees.
