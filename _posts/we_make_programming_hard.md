#Fundamentals
empathy

#State of the world
we work with computers primarily
we dehumanize ourselves this way by encountering issues and finding efficient solutions and repeating this process
its natural to apply this problem to our daily lives and therefore the dehumanization
real life does not work this way
people aren't computers

#Day1 the thought that programming is hard
this is an outdated paradigm. we've come a long way since then

#Read the fucking manual
this statement alone has no empathy

#Contributing to open source
there seems to be a right of passage that if you contribute to open source then you'll be rejected and have to cry in the corner of a room

#Playing nice with others
clients
ourselves (no more imposter syndrome, irrational fears)
each other
gblame
fear of communities

#Hero worshipping
its good to celebrate ones accomplishments but unreasonable to blindly follow them. Remember a lot of the reason why you program is because of your fundamental curiosity
People are naturally human
