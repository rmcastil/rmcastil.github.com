1. create a list of requirements that I'd require out of an apprentice/future employee and make sure I live above and beyond those requirements/expectations
2. create a list of nearby shops (or remote) that would allow me to come in and pair pro-bono and schedule pairing sessions (either monthly or every two weeks)
3. talk at all the local user groups regardless of language just go out and meet interesting people
4. record my daily practice sessions (going to do the foy-Z thing with ruby then move to clojure next) and post to a blog when I learn something new and try to explain it at the the super beginner level
5. blog the crap out of my progress. I want to be able to capture milestones and look at a before and after so that I can actually have feedback regarding how I've progressed

- I'm starting with 1
- then adding 4/5
- 2 and 3 will eventually come
