Have you ever been forced into a corner for an estimate? Looked at git blame and wondered how to resolve the issue with the original author? Or want to be considered a 'consultant' instead of another technical cog in your client's business? The common pitfall in these situations is your ability communicate. In this talk we'll take a look at this basic skill, hack your brain to look at example situations differently and bring you out as a more effective communicator and therefore more awesome developer/human being.
