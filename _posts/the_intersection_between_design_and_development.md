its all about solving problems

- Need to navigation without using the back button
- how to make this visible on an iphone versus the web
- is this text readable
  - what about the line height
  - what about the width of the text
- how can a user navigate
- how can a user find out more about you
- is there too much white space? Does it matter
- can the user see when the post was written
- is there something that attributes the author of the post?
