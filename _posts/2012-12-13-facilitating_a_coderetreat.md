For the global day of coderetreat this year I had the privalege of facilitating an event. It was amazing to see the growth and light clicking in some of the developer's eyes as the day passed. We covered topics such as testing. I found early on that the group wasn't familiar with TDD or thought they had known what it was all about so I wanted to make it a goal for a day to challenge their assumptions. A lot of them had never paired before either so I saught to break that.

I wouldn't have been able to run the event without the help of Michael Buckbee so kudso to him.

What is the goal of this blogpost?

- sending out thanks

I want to thank our food sponsors xTuple and BootStrap Hero as well as the 757 Creative Space for hosting the event.

- showing how easy it is to run a coderetreat

I signed up to host/facilitate the event about a month out and was able to have a pretty full event

- the rewards involved in a coderetreat

You get to see developers grow
You build connections
You can actually assess your skills against other developers
