What is Coderetreat?
===
> Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. - [http://coderetreat.org/]()

Facilitating a Coderetreat
===
Coderetreat is so easy a caveman can do it. No seriously. This is especially true for the Global Day of Coderetreat. Corey and Jim Hurne (a coderetreat superstar) have set it up so anyone (including people who have never come to a coderetreat) can facilitate and host one. You get a checklist of things you need to have done by and what day. You get people willing to teach you and support you when you have questions and concerns. And even a step by step list of things you need to do the day of coderetreat.

I took advantage of all these things and the day went off without any major issues or problems.

What's in it for me?
===
I loved to see the growth and light clicking in some of the developer's eyes as the day passed. We covered topics such as throwing away code, pairing design and testing. I found early on the group wasn't familiar with TDD so I made it a goal for the day to challenge them in this aspect.

Everyone loved the experience and left the event with a number of new friends and practices to try out at work.

So what are you waiting for? No matter where you are in journey as a developer there is a ton you can pick up from attending or facilitating a coderetreat. Find [one](http://coderetreat.org/events) today!
